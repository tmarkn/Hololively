# About

This is the Hololively app written and maintained by [Tmarkn](http://github.com/Tmarkn).

The project can be found at [http://github.com/Tmarkn/hololively](http://github.com/Tmarkn/hololively).

You can find the official application hosted at [http://hololively.com/](http://hololively.com/).

# Rights

This API works off of webscraping the [https://schedule.hololive.tv/lives/](https://schedule.hololive.tv/lives/) site for data. 

This project was intended to provide a usable api to the public for Hololive's Schedule.

I make no money off this project and have no intentions of monetizing off of the work of Hololive.

If this site somehow infinges on your rights or some other problems occur, please find my email below.
