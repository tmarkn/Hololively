It is possible that a monkey broke some of the code in that last update. Keep calm and send a email to [tmarknentertainment@gmail.com](mailto:tmarknentertainment@gmail.com) with details about the problem. We will try our best to keep the monkeys from writing garbage. 

## Why are there monkeys at your company?

We do not make any money from this project. 

Unfortunately, that means that monkeys write our code for us. They are cheaper than actual programmers and generally a lot cleaner.

Feel free to help feed the monkeys by [donating a banana or a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=QT9URWVP5FS24).
